# Case-Study
- Case Study folder contain 2 subfolders (2D & 3D Visulization of Data) each of which contain implementation(ipynb formt) and output results(HTML/PNG format) 
- To run the project in each case first, it is necessary to install all the following Packages which enable us to implement different approaches:
(Since I used Anaconda, the installation commands are based on it)
1. Networkx: conda install -c anaconda networkx
2. Pydot: conda install -c anaconda pydot
3. Graphviz: conda install -c anaconda graphviz
4. Plotly: conda install -c plotly plotly 
5. Chart Studio: conda install -c plotly chart-studio
6. Mpld3: conda install -c conda-forge mpld3 
- After installation of required packges, open the source codes (2D_Visualization.ipynb / 3D_Visualization.ipynb), follow the instruction, and run the cells to obtain desired results
- To explain better the implementation, comments are added on each cell as well.
## Task 1:
- Data Visualization are implemented in diffrerent approaches for each 2D and 3D Visualization 
#### 2D Visualization:
**1. First Approach**: Interactive Network by exploiting Networkx and D3
**2. Second Approach**: 2D Networks in 5 different layouts using only Networkx toolkits
  - Pydot and Graphviz Layout
